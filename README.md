:octocat: Current interests:
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [rust][rust] and [flutter][flutter]
- 👯 I’m looking to maintain abandoned and forgotten [Go][go] projects
- 🕵️‍♂️ Privacy through disinformation is one of my hobbies. Maybe.

⚡ Fun facts:
- I used to host an open-source games review site called [GameBoom][gameboom].
- I lurk on IRC@[EFNet][efnet] more than I should.
- I have never had a Facebook account.
