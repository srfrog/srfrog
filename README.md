Current interests:
- I’m currently learning [@rust][1] and [@sveltejs][2]
- I’m looking to maintain abandoned and forgotten [@go][3] projects
- Privacy through disinformation is one of my hobbies. Maybe.

⚡ Fun facts:
- I used to host an open-source games review site called [GameBoom][4].
- I lurk on IRC@[5][efnet] more than I should.
- I have never had a Facebook account.
