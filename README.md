### 👋 Hi, I’m the engineer behind CastleBytes [![analytics](http://www.google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&t=pageview&tid=UA-549618-11&cid=1199c303-fe5c-4b09-bc41-c6e30eeb9c7a&dp=%2Fsrfrog)]()

**Senior Software Architect** · **Consultant** · **Builder of pragmatic SaaS & data tooling**

I help startups and product teams ship reliable, maintainable backend systems and developer-friendly platforms. I pair deep systems design (Go, Python, cloud infra) with practical product thinking so you get working software and a path to scale.

🔧 What I do:
-	**Consulting & fractional CTO** for early-stage SaaS - architecture, product roadmaps, and technical leadership.
-	**Backend & APIs** - Go + gRPC, REST/BFF patterns, and robust service design.
-	**Data engineering & analytics** - DuckDB / Parquet patterns, data pipelines, observability, and data-driven product features.
-	**Frontend & DX** - TypeScript / React, developer-friendly SDKs, and delightful admin/console experiences.
-	**Cloud & infra** - multi-tenant patterns, deployments, backups, and sane cost/egress tradeoffs.
