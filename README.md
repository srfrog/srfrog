:octocat: Current interests:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) and [flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to maintain abandoned and forgotten [Go](https://github.com/golang/go) projects

âš¡ Fun facts:
- I used to host an open-source games review site called [GameBoom](http://gameboom.net)
- I have spent more on time IRC ([EFNet](http://chat.efnet.org:9090/?channels=%23LiCe&Login=Login)) than I can be proud
- I have never had a Facebook account, and /probably/ never will
